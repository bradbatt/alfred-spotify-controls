Examples
----------------

    $ spot now
    $ spot 75
    $ spot artist
    $ spot rank
    $ spot url
    $ spot <<
    $ spot <
    $ spot
    $ spot search de la soul
    $ spot search artist:de la soul
    $ spot search album:stakes is high
    $ spot search track:sunshine
    $ spot app lastfm
    $ spot shuffle
    $ spot repeat
    $ spot help
    $ spot dev
    $ spot version

Notes
----------------
All growl notifications copy the contents of the notification automatically to your clipboard.

This extension prior to 1.1 had you get info from Spotify by calling: spot i OPT. That will still work but you no longer need to do that. You can just call spot OPT now. The 'spot i' method will always work in order to maintain backwards compatibility.

Growl vs. No Growl
----------------
Two versions of the extension are available, one with Growl and one without. If you wish to use the one without Growl please install the 'Spotify Controls No Growl.alfredextension' file. This will simply copy the growl notification to your clipboard, rather than display it.
